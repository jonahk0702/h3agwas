  - Going much better
  - Need help with Githup and unpacking.
  - Cannot oush to github because ofBPM
  - Issue on python code struct.unpack
    Interestingly, it looks like little endian comes up here.
    This is my biggest issue.
  - If I have already read some data from a file Ptr, can I pass that ptr to another function and carry on reading from where I left off?
  - I am able to use numbers such as 0x80 -> tested it
  - In terms of decode UTF 8, I get 'B' insead of '2'
    Worked on a radom test but not before or after? I was actyally ttesting 0x80 and correct Verision Byte was read
  - Figured out emacs commands. 

**24 March **
- Busy reading from GTCs
  I have been struggling with memory allocation. My anti-virus keeps deleting my build files.
- The the creating of objects and functions seem to be going well.
  Memory allocation is taking some getting used to. 
- I am combining two files from Illumina- The BeadPoolManifest file and the BeadArrayUtility files.
  The other files reference functions from these more for the most complex functions
- Can be a lot more efficient, and need to double check data type sizes.
- Unicodes are still pretty worrying.

- Still want to read GTCs
- Here the issue is that all the way I have found use Python libraries. I need a c library to decode it...
- Idea 1: This seems very promosing. It is the base of that python library. I just need to recode it in C.

- Interesting link
  https://f1000research.com/articles/2-264/v1
    This is Illuminaio, that open source IDAT reader.
  https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/illuminaio
    This seems to be more PLINk orientated
- I have been writing this module in C. All the support files look managable.



**10 March
- Want to read the GTCs. Options:
  https://github.com/Illumina/BeadArrayFiles/blob/develop/examples/gtc_final_report.py - On open Source tool that reads GTCs
  YES! This works!
  This is not quite the right file. Its in example and generate report.
  Got the function and class that does the reading! GenotypeClass(object)
 - There is a way to take the report.txt to .lgen? then to PED through a plink command? is that desireable? Or do i do it manually?
 - Here is another interesting idea:
 https://github.com/nicolazzie/SNPchimpRepo/blob/master/README.md
 There is a program that converts row format to Plink Files... Are we row? And is it okay I dont really understand how Plink works
 But this program takes in a final report and converts it to 
- Need to ask if this is a roundabout and ineffecient way of doing this or if its standard?
  This creates a PED and a MAP file... Is that all

GTC to Plink
- resolved permission errors
- Managed to create a GTC from IDats.
- To make sure, it asks for an Idat folder and not an Idat File. I assumed this meant take the two files with same names just Red and Grn endinds and put them in thier own folder and use that? Seemed to work. As long as there are pairs of folders, its all good. 
- Now that I have a GTC, I need to read it.
- Whenever I run a command, I just run it ie python read.py. I dont worry about scheduling jobs? Is that okay? Potentially. Scott did give another command.
- Is a GTC file binary. Will I be able to write code to read it, or is the pre built code I should use? No.

Converting GTC to PLINK files
- Do I need the iaap-cli to convert IDats to GTCs?
  - I am struggling to run this when I call iaap-cli i get: /opt/exp_soft/bioinf/bin/iaap-cli : permission denied
    And i tried referencing the bcftools but get "No such directory"
  - I have put module load bioinf at bottom of my .bashrc file
- In general once I have to GTCs, I am not exactly sure how to read them. 

- With the Plink generation: I have found a great resource: https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/dist/plink-doc-1.05.pdf
  - I think I am figuring out how it works, but may ask more questions.
  
- Github: I havent uploaded everything, because I wasnt sure if I could upload the IDATs. Instead i just made a folder.
  This is the current files I would like to ask about.

Understanding the iDats
- Wondering if there is a mistake with idat_hash on line 119. It is never declared. 
  - It could be getIdatHash()?
  - My code runs without errors and returns PID and Fs. Not sure what they are.
