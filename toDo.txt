Converting GTC to PLINK files
- Do I need the iaap-cli to convert IDats to GTCs?
  - I am struggling with this: /opt/exp_soft/bioinf/bin/iaap-cli : permission denied
  - I have put module load bioinf at bottom of my .bashrc file
- In general once I have to GTCs, I am not exactly sure how to read them. 

- With the Plink generation: I have found a great resource: https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/dist/plink-doc-1.05.pdf
  - I think I am figuring out how it works, but may ask more questions.
  
  
Understanding the iDats
- Wondering if there is a mistake with idat_hash on line 119. It is never declared. 
  - It could be getIdatHash()?
  - My code runs without errors and returns PID and Fs. Not sure what they are.
