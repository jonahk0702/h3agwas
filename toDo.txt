GTC to Plink
- resolved permission errors
- Managed to create a GTC from IDats.
- To make sure, it asks for an Idat folder and not an Idat File. I assumed this meant take the two files with same names just Red and Grn endinds and put them in thier own folder and use that? Seemed to work. As long as there are pairs of folders, its all good. 
- Now that I have a GTC, I need to read it.
- Whenever I run a command, I just run it ie python read.py. I dont worry about scheduling jobs? Is that okay? Potentially. Scott did give another command.
- Is a GTC file binary. Will I be able to write code to read it, or is the pre built code I should use? No.

Converting GTC to PLINK files
- Do I need the iaap-cli to convert IDats to GTCs?
  - I am struggling to run this when I call iaap-cli i get: /opt/exp_soft/bioinf/bin/iaap-cli : permission denied
    And i tried referencing the bcftools but get "No such directory"
  - I have put module load bioinf at bottom of my .bashrc file
- In general once I have to GTCs, I am not exactly sure how to read them. 

- With the Plink generation: I have found a great resource: https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/dist/plink-doc-1.05.pdf
  - I think I am figuring out how it works, but may ask more questions.
  
- Github: I havent uploaded everything, because I wasnt sure if I could upload the IDATs. Instead i just made a folder.
  This is the current files I would like to ask about.

Understanding the iDats
- Wondering if there is a mistake with idat_hash on line 119. It is never declared. 
  - It could be getIdatHash()?
  - My code runs without errors and returns PID and Fs. Not sure what they are.
